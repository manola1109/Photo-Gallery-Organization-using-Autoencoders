# Photo Gallery Organization using Autoencoders

This project demonstrates how to use an Autoencoder-based deep learning approach to organize and cluster a photo gallery. The main workflow leverages a trained Autoencoder model to extract meaningful features from images and then performs clustering based on these features.

## Overview

The notebook `Photo_Gallery_Organization.ipynb` walks through the full pipeline of organizing a set of images using unsupervised learning techniques:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Uses a trained Autoencoder model to learn and extract feature representations from images.
2. **Clustering**: Applies clustering algorithms (such as KMeans) to group similar images based on their encoded features.
3. **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of the clustering results.

## Methodology

### 1. Extracting Features with Autoencoders
- **Data Preparation**: Images are loaded and preprocessed for model input.
- **Model Training**: An Autoencoder is created and trained on the image dataset to learn low-dimensional feature representations.
- **Feature Extraction**: The encoder part of the Autoencoder is used to transform images into feature vectors.

### 2. Clustering
- **Clustering Algorithm**: The extracted features are clustered (commonly using KMeans) to group similar images together.
- **Result Visualization**: Visual summaries of clusters help to verify the effectiveness of the organization.

## How to Use

1. **Run on Google Colab**:  
   The notebook is ready to run in Google Colab. Open the notebook directly [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/manola1109/Photo-Gallery-Organization-using-Autoencoders/blob/main/Photo_Gallery_Organization.ipynb).

2. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Upload your image dataset (example uses MNIST for demonstration).
   - If using Colab, mount Google Drive and unzip your image data as shown in the notebook.

3. **Execute Cells**:  
   - Follow each section in order: data preparation, model creation and training, feature extraction, clustering, and visualization.

4. **Customization**:  
   - You can adapt the code to use your own image dataset and change clustering parameters as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (as per the notebook)
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, numpy
- Google Colab (recommended for ease of use and GPU acceleration)
